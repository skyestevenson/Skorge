# Skorge

Skorge is a set of tools intended to help game artists working between Autodesk Maya and Unreal Engine.

To run Skorge in Maya, drop the entire folder into your Documents/Maya/version/scripts directory and either run the python script in MayaShelfItem.txt or create a shelf item with its contents and click that.
